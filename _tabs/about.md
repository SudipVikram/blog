# 👋 About Beyond Apogee Blog

Welcome to the official blog of **Beyond Apogee** — where we share our journey of making Robotics, AI, and Python programming accessible to students, educators, and enthusiasts.

We believe that **learning by doing** sparks curiosity and builds confidence. Whether it's building a robot, launching a water rocket, coding a game, or experimenting with AI — our mission is to make technology fun, engaging, and meaningful for learners of all ages.

## 🚀 What We Do

Beyond Apogee has been working across schools in Nepal to bring **hands-on Robotics, AI, and STEAM education** to the classroom. Our initiatives include:

- 🤖 **Robotics Classes** – From lighting up LEDs to launching water rockets and flying RC aircraft.
- 🐍 **Python Programming & Game Development** – Simplified through our very own **SajiloPython Playground IDE** and **SajiloPython Library**.
- 🧠 **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Workshops** – Designed for beginners, using tools like SajiloCV for gesture control and computer vision.
- 🛰️ **Space Science & Rocketry Programs** – Inspiring the next generation of engineers, makers, and thinkers.

## 💡 Why SajiloPython?

We developed **SajiloPython Playground IDE** and its libraries to address a challenge we often saw in classrooms:  
> _“How can we teach real programming and robotics to kids, even on older computers, and without overwhelming them?”_

SajiloPython makes coding **as simple as calling `cat.move_right()`** — so that kids can focus on creativity and logic instead of complex syntax.

Our tools are built to empower **both students and teachers** with the right resources to explore Python, Game Development, AI, and more.
